This site was created by Melisa Dominguez, Jackelyn Hilliard, and Delicia Campbell


Our goal when making this website was to make a new full functioning website; where coustmers could be able to look and purchase JC's products with ease. We all worked together to create this website; we went through and helped each other and worked as a team. However, everyone did have their own part. Melisa worked on...... Jackelyn worked on the design and the look of the website. She also found most of the images we used... Delicia worked on..... 


Our website consists of multiple things, however our most notable features are:

A slide show of products
A new updated logo
A good color palette and font
Embedded link to carry you to ordering page


Thank you, for taking the time to consider our website. We apprecite your time and your consideration.
