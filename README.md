This site was created by Melisa Dominguez, Jackelyn Hilliard, and Delicia Campbell


Our goal when making this website was to make a new full functioning website; where coustmers could be able to look and purchase JC's products with ease. We all worked together to create this website; we went through and helped each other and worked as a team. However, everyone did have their own part. 

Melisa- I worked on both html and css. I created the slideshow with the images my partner chose and also created a new logo for our client. I positioned all the content such as the images, paragraphes, and more. I also created an ordering form in the menu page that send the costomer's order to our client's email. I worked on the footer, adding the information my partner found and positioning it to make it look presentable. The contact us page aslo has a form to sent messages to our client from the website. I also added a parallax to every page in our website, it took me a few tries, but i managed to get it to work properly...

Jackelyn found and chose all the images used, she also worked on finding the reviews along with most of the information on the website. She helped decide on what coors to use and contributed on ideas.... 

Delicia worked on..... 


Our website consists of multiple things, however our most notable features are:

A slide show of products
A new updated logo
An ordering form on the menu page
A parallax in every page of the website
A way to send messages from the webpage to our client
