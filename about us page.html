            JC Sweets Sugar Cookies orignally started as a way to get some extra Christmas money, but it soon turned into the 
            successful business that it is today. The company never would have thought that the people would lvoe these
            cookies as much as they have been. They have worked on various different designs for thei clients ranging from 
            simple designs to even wedding cookies.
